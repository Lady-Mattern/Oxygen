## Our Process

### User Stories
- The user should be able to filter by plant category so they can find a specific plant faster
- The user should be able to create a profile to save their credit card, address and cart
- The user should be able to delete plants from their shopping cart if they find they no longer want them
- The user should be able to learn more about the plant they want to purchase so they can take care of it properly
- The user should be able to easily click a button to add items to their cart to save them for checkout
- The user should be able to see their history of past purchases
- Future Consideration: As a user I can flag my favorite plants to be stored in my profile for easy access
